# 🧬 Genetic Risk Analysis - AI-Powered Health Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven genetic risk assessment system** that predicts potential health risks based on genetic data. Using **machine learning (Random Forest Classifier)**, the model analyzes **gene codes and chromosome count** to determine:  

✅ **Risk Associated Condition**  
✅ **Risk Level (Low, Medium, High, Critical)**  
✅ **Emergency Medicine Recommendations**  
✅ **Guidelines for Risk Management**  

The project features a **Flask API** for backend processing and a **React-based frontend** for an interactive user experience.

## ⚙️ Features  
- **ML-Powered Predictions** – Uses a trained **Random Forest model** for high-accuracy risk assessment.  
- **Real-Time Analysis** – Users input gene codes & chromosome count for **instant** results.  
- **Flask API Integration** – Connects seamlessly with a **React frontend**.  
- **CORS Support** – API accessible from `http://localhost:5173`.
